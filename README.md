# Real State Project

Welcome to my GitHub project! This project is focused on the real estate market in New York, where I have used regression and classification algorithms in Python to analyze and predict important information related to property prices and the likelihood of an apartment selling.

Through this project, I have explored various datasets related to the New York real estate market and utilized machine learning techniques to uncover patterns and insights that can aid in decision-making for both buyers and sellers. By analyzing factors such as location, size, amenities, and more, I have developed models that can predict the price of an apartment and the probability of it selling.).

#### -- Data Mining Methodology 

In this project, I have utilized the CRISP (Cross Industry Standard Process) methodology, a widely used framework for data mining and machine learning projects, to guide my analysis and decision-making process.
